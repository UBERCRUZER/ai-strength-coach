Basic AI strength coach


The project uses fuzzy rules to determine optimal progression rates for a beginner/intermediate strength athlete based on the 3 powerlifting movements (squat/bench/deadlift). The base strength program is loosely based off a fairly popular program called the “Texas Method”. The strength program was modified to have a slightly more aggressive weight progression (as in, it adds weight faster than the unedited version), but then fuzzy rules limit the progression based on an athlete’s fatigue levels, and recovery levels (based on an average score of sleep and stress levels).
